# Missing Proxy Configuration Re-evaluation During Redirects

## Current Issue

The `rebuild_proxies` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class currently returns the original proxy configuration unchanged, without performing any proxy re-evaluation during HTTP redirects. This causes several critical proxy-related functionalities to be missing:

- Proxy configurations are not re-evaluated when redirects occur to different hosts or schemes
- Environment variables like `NO_PROXY` are not considered during redirects, potentially causing requests to go through proxies when they should bypass them
- Missing proxy configurations for new URLs are not populated from environment variables during redirects
- Proxy authentication headers (`Proxy-Authorization`) are not properly managed during redirects

## Expected Behavior

The `rebuild_proxies` method should implement comprehensive proxy configuration management during HTTP redirects by:

1. **Environment-aware proxy resolution**: Re-evaluate proxy settings by considering environment variables and the `trust_env` session setting for the redirected URL
2. **NO_PROXY compliance**: Respect `NO_PROXY` environment variable settings to strip proxy configurations when redirecting to URLs that should bypass proxies
3. **Proxy configuration completion**: Populate missing proxy configurations for the target URL scheme when they were stripped by previous redirects
4. **Proxy authentication management**: Properly handle `Proxy-Authorization` headers by removing existing ones and adding new authentication headers when proxy URLs contain embedded credentials

The method should return a properly resolved proxy dictionary that reflects the correct proxy configuration for the redirected request, ensuring that proxy behavior remains consistent and secure throughout the redirect chain.

## Interface Requirements

The method signature must remain:
```python
def rebuild_proxies(self, prepared_request, proxies):
```

The method should return a dictionary containing the resolved proxy configuration for the prepared request, taking into account the session's `trust_env` setting and the current proxy configuration.
